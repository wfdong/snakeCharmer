# snakeCharmer
An algorithm practice of Sofihub

Main idea:
Use Euclidean distance to decide the next step of snake.

It maybe have several ways, just select one of them as the result. If we want to record all the shortest ways, we can record all the possible ways have seen so far at the time of same Euclidean distance.
